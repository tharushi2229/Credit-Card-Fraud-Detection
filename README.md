Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning and Python.
The dataset used contains credit card transactions, where the challenge is to identify fraudulent ones among a highly imbalanced dataset.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and exploration

Handling imbalanced datasets

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Performance metrics comparison (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy & Pandas (data manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (machine learning models)

⚙️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-


(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # for Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

📊 Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated on:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC

Since fraud detection is an imbalanced classification problem, more emphasis is placed on Recall and ROC-AUC.

🚀 Future Improvements

Try advanced techniques like SMOTE or ADASYN for better class balancing

Experiment with ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost

Deploy as a web app using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit
